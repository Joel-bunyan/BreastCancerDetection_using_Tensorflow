# BreastCancerDetection_using_Tensorflow

Some developers at google have developed some of the neural network architectures that are used most often in the world of deep learning and have collectively 
built a library called Tensorflow for both modeling tasks and serving tasks. Here, we are going to use Tensorflow's library to develop a simple binary 
classification model. The only difference between the regressive model and the classification model is that we are going to add an activation function to the 
output to convert the output of the neural to be in the required format or range. And we are oing to calculate the derivative for the output of the activation 
funtion. 

In the upcoming projects, we are going to build sophisticated architectures using the Tensorflow library
